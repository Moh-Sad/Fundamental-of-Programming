    <h1> MY HTML Notes</h1>
    <p> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
        
    <p>HTML tags always start with &lt; sign and end with a > tag. These are usually referred to as <em>angle brackets.</em></p>
        
    <p>markup refers to text that has a special meaning, typically used in the context of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). In HTML, markup is used to instruct the browser on how to display content.</p>

    Whitespace: ia a general term for spaces, tabs, and line breaks.<br><br>

    <p>hypertext: is a text that can have links or references.</p>

    <p>nesting: is the idea that some bits of code can go inside other bits of code.</p>

    <p>syntax: are rules having to do with how the parts of a language can be put together.</p>

    <p>void tag (also known as a self-closing tag): is an element that does not require a closing tag. These tags are used to insert elements that do not have any content between an opening and closing tag. Instead, they are self-contained.</p>

    <p>mark: is a HTML tag used to <mark>highlight</mark> words.</p>

    <p>sup tag: is used to display text in superscript, which means the text appears slightly above the normal line of text. This is often used for mathematical exponents, footnotes, or other annotations. For e.g. E = MC<sup>2</sup>.</p>

    <p>sub tag: is used to display text in subscript, which means the text appears slightly below the normal line of text. This is commonly used in chemical formulas, mathematical expressions, or to denote specific notations. For e.g. H <sub>2</sub> O.</p>

    <p>strong tag: in HTML is used to indicate that the text inside it has strong importance or emphasis. By default, text wrapped in the strong tag is displayed in boldface in most browsers.</p>

    <p>Headings: are defined using the h1 to h6 tags, where h1 represents the highest level of heading (usually the main title) and h6 represents the lowest level of heading. Here's a brief overview of each heading tag:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>h1: Main heading (largest)
            <li>h2: Subheading (second largest)
            <li>h3: Sub-subheading
            <li>h4: Fourth level heading
            <li>h5: Fifth level heading
            <li>h6: Sixth level heading (smallest)
        </ul>
    <p> Block-level elements: take up the full width available, meaning they start on a new line and stack vertically. Examples: div, p, h1, h2, ul, li, section, and footer.</p>
    
    <p>Inline elements: only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line. They flow within the content of block-level elements. Examples: span, a, strong, em, and img.</p>

    <p>div element: stands for "division" and is used as a generic container for other HTML elements. It does not have any semantic meaning on its own but is very useful for structuring and styling web pages.</p>

    <p>ul element: is a block-level element that defines an unordered list. Each item in the list is typically marked with a bullet point.</p>

    <p>ol element: is a block-level element that defines an ordered list. Each item in the list is typically preceded by a number or letter, indicating its position in the sequence. For Example:</p>
    <p>List of Programming Languages</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>C</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Elements with Optional Closing Tags:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Paragraph</li>
        <li>Division</li>
        <li>List of items</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: When a closing tag is left off in HTML, the browser uses a set of parsing rules to determine when to automatically close the element.</p>

    <p>The type attribute for "ol" offers several options for list item markers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"1" for numbers (the default)
        <li>"A" for uppercase letters
        <li>"a" for lowercase letters
        <li>"I" for uppercase Roman numerals
        <li>"i" for lowercase Roman numerals
    </ul>

    <p>Nested lists: are lists that contain other lists as their elements. For Example:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Cars
            <ul>
                <li>Toyota</li>
                <li>Nissan</li>
                <li>BMW</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Drinks
            <ul>
                <li>Coca Cola</li>
                <li>Pepsi</li>
                <li>Merinda</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used within the "a" tag to specify the destination of the link.</p>

    <p>"a" tag in HTML is used to create hyperlinks, which allow users to navigate from one page to another. The "a" tag stands for "anchor," and it is essential for linking web pages together.</p>

    <a href="./notes.html"> Example of Anchor Tag</a>

    <p>img tag: is used to add an image on ypur website. For example:</p>
    <img src="https://placebear.com/800/600" alt="Bear">
